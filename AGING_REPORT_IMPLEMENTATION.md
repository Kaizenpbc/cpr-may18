   - Accurate balance calculations accounting for verified payments only
   - Optimized performance with proper indexing considerations
   - Dynamic filtering by organization and date range

2. **API Endpoints**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/accounting/aging-report
   GET /api/v1/accounting/organizations
   ```

3. **Data Structure**
   ```javascript
   {
     report_metadata: {
       generated_at: timestamp,
       as_of_date: date,
       organization_filter: string,
       total_records: number
     },
     executive_summary: {
       total_outstanding: number,
       total_overdue: number,
       total_invoices: number,
       overdue_invoices: number,
       overdue_percentage: string,
       collection_efficiency: string
     },
     aging_summary: [...],
     organization_breakdown: [...],
     invoice_details: [...]
   }
   ```

   - Professional styling

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - Real-time filtering
   - CSV export functionality
   - Cache management (5-minute stale time)
   - Tabbed interface for different views

## üìä Key Features

### Executive Summary
- **Total Outstanding**: Sum of all unpaid invoice balances
- **Total Overdue**: Sum of invoices past due date
- **Collection Efficiency**: Percentage of current vs overdue
- **Overdue Rate**: Percentage of overdue invoices

### Aging Buckets
- **Current**: Not yet due
- **1-30 Days**: 1-30 days past due
- **31-60 Days**: 31-60 days past due
- **61-90 Days**: 61-90 days past due
- **90+ Days**: More than 90 days past due

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: <25% overdue
- **Medium Risk**: 25-50% overdue
- **High Risk**: >50% overdue

## üöÄ Access Instructions

1. **Start the servers** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
